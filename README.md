## Installation

The former luchador, now the chief web developer, managed to achieve his greatest challenge yet in professional wrestling — taking a web application from concept to production. The bell rang, and it was off to the races! He navigated to the root directory of the project, and bodyslammed the dependencies to the mat with `npm install`. When the dust cleared, a roar ensued from the crowd as he exploded onto the scene and commanded `npm run start`, launching the application. But the crowd was hungry for more - they wanted the webpack bundle. Nothing could satisfy them but for the web developer to demolish the JavaScript files into submission with webpack. This was just the beginning to show the crowd what a Progressive Web Apps would look like.

In the second act, content from the text editor was entered and it was almost as if the crowd could feel it being saved in the IndexedDB. And just when they thought it really couldn't get any better for a web application, the luchador tempted the crowd to click the install button on the text editor window and BOOM, it was a wrapped up application, with an icon on the home screen beatifully placed for all to see. He had taken a web application from concept to production just like that. The crowd was in a frenzy. Rocking the ring side, the web developer reigned victorious.

## Usage
The crowd in the arena goes wild as a wrestler enters the stage to introduce his revolutionary new application. Boasting about his modern JavaScript prowess and a single-page application setup, he runs through the features of his state-of-the-art text editor web application - designed to keep your precious data safe from prying eyes with data persistence techniques such as IndexedDB! The crowd is mesmerized as he rattles off the necessary criteria for a successful PWA. He takes the audience to the next level by informing them about the ability to save the app to their desktop as an icon, powered by a registered service worker packed in with Workbox to cache static assets and make subsequent page load times faster than ever. He winds up the routine by informing the crowd of the ultimate ease of deployment to Heroku with the right scripts to optimize the webpack application. The crowd erupts in applause, celebrating the wrestler’s groundbreaking application.

In the world of high-quality text editor applications, the contenders are determined to bring revolutionary approaches to the web.

Two groups, each with its own distinct philosophy, have and continue to battle for superior solutions and ultimate dominance in the industry.

The first group, lead by the original innovators, is committed to a single-page application design criterion that meets PWA standards. Through data persistence techniques, these contenders are able to ensure data is reliably retrieved in case of an unsupported browser. 

The second challenge comes from the upstarts. Leading with an offering of a downloadable web application with a registered service worker, static assets pre-cached, and subsequent pages and static assets available in case of an unsupported browser. This team is focused on creating and editing notes, code snippets, and other documents without an internet connection, while leveraging client server folder structure, JavaScript files bundled with webpack, and next-gen JavaScript for compatibility. To top it off, they rely on IndexedDB for data storage and proper build scripts for webpack for deployments to Heroku or other hosting services.

Which group will prevail and who shall be crowned champion of the web editor industry? Place your bets, the battle begins now!
